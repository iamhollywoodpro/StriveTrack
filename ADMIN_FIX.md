# Admin Password Fixed

The admin password has been updated to work correctly with the bcrypt hashing in production.

## Fixed Login Credentials:
- Email: iamhollywoodpro@protonmail.com  
- Password: password123

## Issue Resolution:
The original password hash was incompatible with the bcrypt implementation in Cloudflare Workers.
Updated the password hash using a fresh bcrypt generation from the working registration system.

## Verification:
- Authentication system tested and working
- Admin login verified with role permissions
- All API endpoints accessible with proper session management
